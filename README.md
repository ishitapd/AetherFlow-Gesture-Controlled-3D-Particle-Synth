# AetherFlow-Gesture-Controlled-3D-Particle-Synth
AetherFlow is a high-performance 3D particle engine built with Three.js and MediaPipe. It uses real-time Computer Vision to track hand gestures, allowing users to morph 10,000+ particles into shapes like hearts and planets via custom GLSL shaders. A fusion of generative art and AI-driven interaction.
